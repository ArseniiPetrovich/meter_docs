# Welcome to Meter!

Meter is DeFi infrastructure with a built-in, crypto-native, metastable currency, MTR.  It uses HotStuff based PoS consensus with MTRG \(Meter Governance Token\) to manage the blockchain ledger.  Meter functions as a highly-decentralized, high-performance side chain for Ethereum and other public chains.

We are working to achieve three things with Meter’s DeFi infrastructure: 

1. Complete Bitcoin’s original vision and create a metastable sound money independent of the fiat system. 
2. Address performance issues that current chains are facing with our Hybrid PoW/PoS + HotStuff consensus that is backward compatible with Ethereum. 
3. Interconnect with other public chains like ETH and run as a side chain to enable scaling and value interaction.
