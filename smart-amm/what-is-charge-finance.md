# What is Smart AMM?

Smart AMM is Meter's next generation Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) technology built to improve the DEX experience for both traders and liquidity providers' \(LPs\) profit by offering:

1. **Lower slippage for traders:** More efficient use of liquidity pools compared to Uniswap allows for less slippage and a better trading experience.
2. **Profit maximization for LPs:** Meter's Smart AMM increases profit and allows full control for LPs to customize their risk exposure. [Read more about now our Smart AMM works here](how-meters-smart-amm-engine-works.md).
3. **Speed and scalability:** Smart AMM will be initially built on Ethereum. When it migrates to Meter's high performance DeFi infrastructure, it will be equipped with second-level oracle data references and able to process thousands of trades per second.
