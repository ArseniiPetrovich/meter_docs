# Cross-Chain Interoperability Goals

One of Meter's goals is maximizing interoperability with other public blockchains. Meter has already achieved backwards compatibility with the EVM \(Ethereum Virtual Machine\).

Our interoperability goals:

1. Further improve our Hybrid PoW/PoS + HotStuff Consensus performance.
2. Enable decentralized value interaction between these blockchains.

In the past year we built a bridge to Ethereum and have partnerships with Elrond and Matic to do the same. Many more similar partnerships are coming, so stay tuned!
