# Cross-Chain Interoperability Goals

One of Meter's goals is to achieve interoperability with other public blockchains to:

1. Address performance issues with our Hybrid PoW/PoS + HotStuff consensus that is backward compatible with EVM. 
2. Enable decentralized value interaction between these chains.

We have already built a bridge to Ethereum, and have partnered with Elrond and Matic to do the same, with many more similar partnerships coming.
