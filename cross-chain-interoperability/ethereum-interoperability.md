# Cross Chain Info

## The Meter Passport

[Meter Passport](https://passport.meter.io) allows MTRG and other ERC20 and ERC721 tokens to be transferred among the supported blockchains. 

Here is important information about MTRG on different chains.  To reduce user confusion, we have decided to call all wrapped versions of MTRG on different chains as MTRG.  The Ethereum version was depolyed earlier and was called eMTRG.

Ethereum:

1. eMTRG
   1. Contract address: [0xBd2949F67DcdC549c6Ebe98696449Fa79D988A9F](https://etherscan.io/token/0xBd2949F67DcdC549c6Ebe98696449Fa79D988A9F)
   2. [eMTRG / ETH Uniswap pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0x837f68d11cd15e8ab10dd5f3f210516f2cf2bcfb)

## Liquidity Mining

On Ethereum, we are partnering with [ChadSwap](https://chadswap.finance) for liquidity mining program. Uniswap liquidity providers could stake the eMTRG/ETH LP tokens in on ChadSwap to earn around 200% annual returns, of which 25% is vested immediately and 75% will be vested linearly over a year.

Whether you are participating in the liquidity mining for ChadSwap, you will receive 30% APY airdrops in eMTRG directly sent to your wallet on a weekly basis
